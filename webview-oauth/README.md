## Webview + OAuth2 Authentication Spike

## OAuth2

- specifies a process for resource owners (users) to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials.
- allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner (user) 
- The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server
- Oauth != OATH
- provides specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and smart devices
- OAuth2 is NOT backwards compatible with OAuth1
